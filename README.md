# Palindrome Checker App

This repository contains the Palindrome Checker App developed as part of the assessment test for the Suitmedia internship program in mobile development.

## Overview

The Palindrome Checker App is designed to determine whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). This application evaluates user-inputted text to identify if it qualifies as a palindrome.
